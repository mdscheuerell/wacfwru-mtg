# History of Yelloweye Rockfish in Puget Sound

.blue-text[

## Very little exploitation prior to 1960s

## Harvest increased after 1974 Boldt Decision

## 77% decline from 1977 to 2014

## Listed as _threatened_ &nbsp; under ESA in 2010

# ESA listing & status review

# Question

]

## How do we assess the status of a data-limited, ESA-listed population?

.green-text[

<br>

# Answer

]

## Use a stock assessment model developed for commercial species under Magnuson-Stevens


---

# Approach

.blue-text[

## Use length data from 3 hook-and-line research surveys (1974–1977, 2014–2015, 2017–2019)

## Develop catch scenarios from recreational (1970-2007) and commerical harvest (1921-2007)
