# Fun facts about Yelloweye Rockfish

.large.white-text[

- Reproduce at 10-20 years

- Max size of 1 m & 18 kg

- Live up to 120 years

]


---

# History of Yelloweye Rockfish in Puget Sound

.large.blue-text[

- Very little exploitation prior to 1960s

- Harvest increased after 1974 Boldt Decision

- 77% decline from 1977 to 2014

- Listed as **threatened** under ESA in 2010

]

# ESA listing & status review

.large.blue-text[

- Genetically distinct from outer coast populations

- Proportion of unfished reproductive potential chosen as recovery criterion

# Solution

]

## Use a stock assessment model developed for commercial species under Magnuson-Stevens


---

# NOAA's Stock Synthesis 

.large.blue-text[

- Statistical age-structured population model

- Modifed to use catch and length data only

]


---

# Approach

.large.blue-text[

- Use length data from 3 hook-and-line research surveys (1 in 1970s, 2 in 2010s)

- Develop catch scenarios from recreational (1970-2007) and commerical harvest (1921-2007)

# Data

.large.blue-text[

- Spending info from USFWS annual reports

- Adult salmon counts from Bonneville Dam (USACE)

- Hatchery releases from Regional Mark Information System

- Environmental data from NOAA & Columbia Basin Research

# Approach

# Summary

.large.blue-text[

- Spending & hatchery production are associated with substantial increases in returning fish, but...

- Returns due to spending & hatchery releases do not exceed those from hatchery estimates alone
